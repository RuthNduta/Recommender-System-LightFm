# Recommender System Using LightFm library

## Indroduction

The code uses the lightfm recommender system library to train a hybrid content-based + collaborative algorithm that uses the three loss function WARP,BFS,Logistic on the movielens dataset. The movielens dataset contains movies and ratings from over 1700 users. Once trained, our script prints out recommended movies for whatever users from the dataset that we choose to terminal.
